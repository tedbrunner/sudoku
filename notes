Sudoku

game is 9x9 spots
game has 9 of 3x3 squares of spots 
9 values
each spot can be either
- one "determined" value eg. at start
- unknown and up to 9 "possible" values


view 1
- 9 separate "levels" for each value where each spots of the 9x9 can be 
-- "determined" to be that value, display as solid
-- "possible" to be that value, display as greyed out
-- "excluded" from that value, display as blank
   view that level: spot is either determined, possible, excluded 
view 2
- one "columnar" where each spot of the 9x9 is either
-- a "determined" value
-- a "list" of possible values
view 3
- one "game" where each spot of the 9x9 is either
-- a "determined" value
-- no display

initialize
for each value
 for each spot
  set to possible
input starting position
 for each starting value
  go to that spot and level
   set that spot to determined

algorithm 1 "exclude by 1" or "It is there so it can't be here."
for each of 9 values/levels
 for each determined spot
   remove the possibles along that row - each other spot becomes excluded
   remove the possibles along that column - each other spot becomes excluded
   remove the possibles within that square - each other spot becomes excluded

algorithm 2 "exclude by 2" or "It is in that square in one of two spots, so it can't be here."
 for each of the 9 values
  for each square
   if only two possibles of a value
    if both in a row, remove the possibles along that row, outside of the square
    if both in a column, remove the possibles along that column, outside of the square
algorithm 2b - extend from two to three

algorithm 4 - "It must be in that row/column somewhere"
 for each row (and again for each column)
  how many spots un-determined?  less than 3 or 4?
  create list of unassigned values (eg. 2,5,9)
  for each undetermined spot in this row (and again for column)
   for each unassigned value - can it go here?
    check for exclusion from column and square (and again for row and square)
     mark as possible or excluded
  for each unassigned value on this row - is there only one possible spot in row?
   set value as determined in this spot


****
algorithm 3 "convert"
for each of the 9 values/levels
 for each of 9 squares
  sum the states of all 9 spots
   evaluate the summary

   evaluation criteria
   if more than one spot is determined, error
   if only one spot is determined, continue
   if only one spot is possible, CONVERT it to determined, and log(determined)
   if two spots are possible, log(what else deb and I should mark)
   otherwise, continue

algorithm 2b
 for each of 9 rows
  sum the states of all 9 spots
   evaluate the summary

algorithem 2c
 for each of 9 columns
  sum the states of all 9 spots
   evaluate the summary
